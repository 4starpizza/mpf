This config folder contains several YAML-based configuration files. They are
not all intended to be used with all games, rather, there are just a bunch of
different examples which you can check out.

Most of them are used for Judge Dredd and a P-ROC. But we also have bigshot.yaml
which is used for our Big Shot EM conversion.

More information about these machine configuration files is here:
