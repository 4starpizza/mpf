===============================

Let's build a pinball machine!

The Mission Pinball Framework (MPF) is an open source, cross-platform, software framework for powering real pinball
machines.

MPF is written in Python 3. It can run on Windows, OS X, and Linux with the same code and configurations.

MPF interacts with real, physical pinball machines via modern pinball controller hardware such as the Multimorphic
P-ROC or P3-ROC, FAST Pinball controllers, or Open Pinball Project (OPP) open source hardware. You can use it to power
your own custom-built machine or to update the software in existing Williams, Bally, Stern, or Data East machines.

MPF is a work-in-progress that is not yet complete, though we're actively developing it and checking
in several commits a week. It's MIT licensed, actively developed by fun people, and supported by a vibrant pinball-loving
community.

The MPF project homepage is here : https://missionpinball.com/mpf/
